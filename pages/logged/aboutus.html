      <h4>OUR STORY</h4>
    <h4>Why should you choose us?<h4>
      <p>
'Most people think buying is investing, but they're wrong. It doesn't make you an investor any more than buying groceries makes you a chef', said Gary Keller.

The term 'Real Estate' has been synonymous with only buying-selling of land or a built up asset and has come off age. What stands before us today is an opportunity to take personal ownership of our financial future and making the Real Estate Wealth grow.

Inspired by this very need to break the status quo and encourage people to look at Real Estate Wealth Management beyond just 'buying-selling' diad, Tejasco began its operations in 2014 as the single most professionally run Real Estate Advisory and Portfolio Management firm with the intent to be The Family Office for Your Real Estate Wealth.

Headquartered in country's fastest growing city, the IT capital of India, Tejasco began its operations from Bengaluru and continues to expand its reach into other cities - Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai, with an ever expanding presence across India, through which we service more than 4000 registered clients and their families both in India and overseas thus, generating an asset value in excess of $1 billion and growing.

Backed with the wealth of experience of the ex-banker team that came together to create Tejasco, we at Tejasco strive to create value and experience like no other. As we continue to grow, we remain rooted to our core purpose of putting the 'customer' back in 'customer service'.
